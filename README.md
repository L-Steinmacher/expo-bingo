# expo-bingo
a bingo board built with React Native/Expo with randomely generated board and Kung-fu action!

## Get it going!
- clone the repo
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm run start` to launch the dev server

Since this is a moble app the iOS version may be viewed using Xcode, or Android with Android studio OR download the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app on your moble device and see how the app runs on your device by scanning the QR code once the development server is running.

## TODO

- [ ] Build out Backend for entering in raffle once you get bingo
- [ ] Clean up index marks on cards and console logs
- [ ] Fix scuffed Login re-routing OR prompt user to create username once they launch the app
- [ ] Deploy to either the Android and IOS strore or figure out the sideloading on user devices (prefer side loading so we don't have to worry about the store)
- [ ] Add Santa Hat Pixel art to the logo! ðŸŽ…
- [ ] Profit ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’°
